## flow of costs
- two types
	- perpetual inventory system
	- periodic inventory system
- **perpetual inventory system**
	- record of each inventory purchase or sale
	- a company determines the cost of goods sold each time a sale occurs
	- even under perpetual inventory systems, companies perform physical inventory counts
- **periodic system
	- companies do not keep detailed inventory records of the goods on hand throughout the period
	- determine the cost of goods sold only at the end of the accounting period
	- algorithm:
		1) determine cost of goods on hand @ beginning of period
		1) add to cost of goods purchased
		1) subtract the cost of goods on hand (via physical inventory count) at the end of the accounting period
- **purchase invoice**
	- indicates the total purchase price and other relevant information
	- under the perpetual inventory system, companies record purchases of merchandise for sale in the inventory account
- recording sales under a perpetual inventory system
	- every sales transaction should be supported by a business document that provides written evidence of the sale
	- for each sale, the seller (1) increases accounts receivable or cash, as well as Sales revenue; and (2) increases cost of goods sold and decreases inventory. As a result, the inventory account will show at all times the amount of inventory that should be on hand
	- returns and sales:
		- To record credit for returned goods, the seller uses the Sales Returns and Allowances account. Sales Returns and Allowances is shown as a subtractive item under revenues on the income statement. The company also decreases Accounts Receivable at the selling price. If goods are returned, Inventory is increased and Cost of Goods Sold is decreased for the cost of the goods.
		- sales are subtracted from revenues and added to sales discounts" account
- classifying inventory
	- two systems
		- merchandising
			- goods are owned by the company and in a form ready to sell
		- manufacturing
			- raw materials, in process, finished goods, etc...
	- inventory cost includes all costs of getting the inventory to the business (transport and such)
	- specific identification
		- keeping track in individual products and their price to accuratly calculate ending inventory & C.O.G.S.
- cost flow assumptions
	- for the many cases that specific identification is not practicle
	- methods
		1) first-in, first-out (FIFO)
		1) last-in , first-out (LIFO)
		1) average-cost
	- FIFO
		- assumes that the earliest goods purchased are the first to be sold
	- LIFO
		- assumes that the latest goods purchased are the first to be sold
	- average
		- allocates the cost of goods available for sale on the basis of the weighted-average unit cost incurred
		
# cost flow methods and how they affect financial statements

- 3 factors when choosing a cost flow method
	1) income statement
	1) balance sheet
	1) tax
- inflation heavly affects cost flow depending on cost flow method used
- if a company uses a method to reduce tax's, it must use that same method for financial reports

# receivables

- can either write off bad debt or allowance it
- bad debt expense
	- writes off cost to an account
	- only shows actual loss from uncollectibles
	- not acceptible for financial reporting purposes
- allowance
	- create an allowance in assets to allow the balance sheet to actually ballance

- multiple step income statement is a thing
- profit margin
	- net income divided by net sales
