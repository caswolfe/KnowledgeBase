# Chapter 4

- revenue recognition principle
	- companies recognize revenue in the accounting period in which the performance obligation is satisfied
- expense recognition principle
	- "let the expenses follow the revenues"
	- companies recognize expenses in the period in which they make efforts (consume assets or incur liabilities) to generate revenue
- accrual-basis accounting
	- transactions that change a company's financial statements are recorded in the periods in which the events occur
	- companies also recognize expenses when incurred (the expense recognition principle), even if cash was not paid.
- cash-basis accounting
	- companies record revenue at the time they receive cash
	- they also record an expense at the time they pay out cash
	- **Cash-basis accounting is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)**

## adjustments
- changes made to accounts at the end of the accounting period to ensure that the revenue recognition and expense recognition principles are followed
- Adjustments are required every time a company prepares financial statements.
- Every adjustment will include one income statement account and one balance sheet account
- deferrals
	- prepaid expenses
		- expenses paid in cash before they are used or consumed
	- unearned revenues
		- cash received before services are performed
- accruals
	- accrued revenues
		- revenues for services performed but not yet received in cash or recorded
	- accrued expenses
		- expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash or recorded
- prepaid expenses
	- payments of expenses that will benefit more than one accounting period as assets
	- ex:insurance, supplies, advertising, and rent
	- companies make prepayments when they purchase buildings and equipment
	- **prepaid expenses are costs that expire either with the passage of time (e.g., rent and insurance) or through use (e.g., supplies)**
	- Prior to adjustment, assets are overstated and expenses are understated. Therefore, an adjustment for prepaid expenses results in an increase to an expense account and a decrease to an asset account
- supplies
	-  companies recognize supplies expense at the end of the accounting period. At the end of the accounting period, the company counts the remaining supplies. The difference between the unadjusted balance in the Supplies (asset) account and the actual cost of supplies on hand represents the supplies used (an expense) for that period
- insurance
	- must be paid in advance, often for multiple months. The cost of insurance (premiums) paid in advance is recorded as an increase in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. At the financial statement date, companies increase Insurance Expense and decrease Prepaid Insurance for the cost of insurance that has expired during the period
- depreciation
	-  a building is expected to be of service for many years, it is recorded as an asset, rather than an expense, on the date it is acquired. Companies record such assets at cost, as required by the historical cost principle. To follow the expense recognition principle, companies allocate a portion of this cost as an expense during each period of the asset's useful life. Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset to expense over its useful life
	- Depreciation is an allocation concept, not a valuation concept. That is, depreciation allocates an asset's cost to the periods in which it is used. Depreciation does not attempt to report the actual change in the value of the asset
- unearned revenues
	- Companies record cash received before services are performed by increasing a liability account called unearned revenues
	- the adjustment for unearned revenues results in a decrease to a liability account and an increase to a revenue account
- accrued revenues
	- revenues for services performed but not yet recorded at the statement date
	- an adjustment for accrued revenues results in an increase to an asset account and an increase to a revenue account
- accrued expenses
	- expenses incurred but not yet paid or recorded at the statement date
	- an adjustment for accrued expenses results in an increase to an expense account and an increase to a liability account
