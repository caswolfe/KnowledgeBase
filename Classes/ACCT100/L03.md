	- periodicity assumption
		- the life of a business can be subdivided into "artificial" time periods to aid financial reporting
	- going concern assumption
		- assume that business will remain operational in the foreseeable future

## Principles in Financial Reporting
- measurement principles
	- historical cost principle
		- companies record assets at their cost
			- (appreciation is not accounted for)
			- land bought at 100k 2 years ago, now worth 175k is reported at 100k
	- fair value principle
		- assets and liabilities reported at their current market price
- full disclosure principle
	- companies must disclose all "circumstances and events" which would affect financial statement users
		- ex: "The Process Upset" @ Eastman
- cost constraint
	- weight of the cost of delivering financial information by the company with the benefit financial statement users will gain

## Accounting Transactions
- economic events that require recording in the financial statements
	- changes to assets, liabilities, or stockholders' equity
- transaction analysis
	- viewing the effects of an economic event on the accounting equation
- the accounting equation must all ways balance
	- remember: <code>(assets) = (liabilities) + (stockholders' equity)</code>
