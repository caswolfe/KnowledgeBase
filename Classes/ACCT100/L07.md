## plant asset
- a physical object which is used in operation of a business, not intended for sale to a customer
- when determining the cost of a plant asset:
    - cost consists of all expenditures necessary to acquire an asset and make it ready for its intended use
    - revenue expenditures
        - If a cost is not included in a plant asset account, then it must be expensed immediately
    - capital expenditures
        - costs that are not expensed immediately but are instead included in a plant asset account
- additions & improvements are capital expenditures

### depreciation methods
1) strait line
    - most used (95% of companies in the us)
        - <code> [cost] - [salvage value] = [depreciable cost]</code>
        - <code>[depreciable cost] + [useful life (yrs)] = [depreciation expense]</code>
1) declining-balance
    - more depreciation in the beginning of the assets life, total value asymptotically approaches 0. (depreciation amount decreases as time goes on)
1) units-of-activity
    - best suited to factory machinery
    - based on use expected from the asset
- each method will converge to the same total depreciation amount

### sale of plant assets
- if a company sells an asset for more than book value, they received a *gain on disposal*, where as if they loose money it is called a *loss on disposal*

### accounting for intangible assets
- If an intangible has a limited life, the company allocates its cost over the asset's useful life using a process similar to depreciation
- **amortization**
    - allocating to expense the cost of an intangible asset
- assets w/ indefinite lives should not be amortized
- examples of intangible assets
    - patents
    - research and development costs
    - copyrights
    - trademarks and trade names
    - franchises
    - goodwill

### asset turnover
- the amount of money generated with an asset
- <code>[asset turnover] = [net sales] / [average total assets]</code>
- profit margin revisited:
    - <code>[profit margin] * [asset turnover] = [return on assets]</code>
    - <code>[return on assets] = [net income] / [average total assets]</code>
