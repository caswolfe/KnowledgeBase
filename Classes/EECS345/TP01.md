# Test #1 Prep

## Scheme Structure

- data structures
    1) atom
    1) list
    1) number
    1) boolean
- notes that list are linked lists
- lists within a list exist
- functions
    - <code>(define name ~)</code>
    - <code>(lambda (x) (+ 1 x))</code>
    - <code>(define my-add (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)))</code>
- basic functions
    - <code>car</code>
        - first element of a list
        - <code>(car '(a b c d)) -> 'a</code>
    - <cdoe>cdr</code>
        - all elements of a list except the first one
        - <code>(cdr '(a b c d)) -> '(b c d)</code>
    - <code>null?</code>
        - checks if an element is null
        - <code>(null? '()) -> #t</code>
        - <code>(null? '(a)) -> #f</code>
- more functions
    - <code>cons</code>
        - used to build two lists
        - <code>(cons 'a '(b c)) -> '(a b))</code>
        - **NOTE:** <code>(cons 'a 'b) -> '(a * b)</code>
            - this is a pair and not a list
            - to avoid, you can start w/ adding an atom to an empty list
        - <code>(cons '(a b) '(c d)) -> '((a b) c d)</code>
    - <code>list?</code>
        - returns true if the parameter is a list
        - <code>(list? '()) -> #t</code>
    - <code>pair?</code>
        - returns true if the parameter has a car and a cdr
        - <code>(pair? '()) -> #f</code>

## Syntax & Semantics

- syntax
    - the form of an instruction
- semantics
    - what the instruction means
- syntax rules
    - written in "Backus-Naur Form" (BNF)
    - exists as a list of production rules
    - can use these rules to create precedence & associativity
    - left associativity
        - the new non-terminal is on the right
        - ex: <code>[s] -> [s] op [a] | [a]</code>
    - right associativity
        - the new non-terminal is on the left
        - ex: <code>[s] -> [a] op [s] | [a]</code>
    - example unambiguous rule set
        - <code>[s] -> [s] + [a] | [a]</code>
        - <code>[a] -> [a] * [b] | [b]</code>
        - <code>[b] -> a | b | c | ([s])</code>

### Static Semantics

- expressing rules we can't with the BNF production rules
    - examples:
        - "all variables should be declared before they are used"
        - "all function calls must have the correct # of parameters"
        - "check that all expressions have the correct types"
- given a parse tree, can **decorate** the tree w/ attributes
    - ex:
        - <code>[s] -> [deceleration] (statement]</code>
        - <code>[s] -> [type] [var]</code>
        - <code>[s] -> [assign] [s]</code>
        - <code>[assign] -> [var] = [value]</code>
        - <code>[value] -> [value] + [b] | [b]</code>
        - <code>[b] -> [b] * [c] | [c]</code>
        - <code>[c] -> [number] | [var]</code>
- types
    - suppose we want to parse
        - <code>int z;</code>
        - <code>double x;</code>
        - <code>x = 30 + 5 * z</code>
    - type attribute
        - attach the type of an expression to its node on the parse tree
        - the value of the type moves upward
        - type is a **synthesized** attribute, determined by its children
    - type table
        - attribute that stores type declared variables in the program
        - this is an **inherited** attribute
        - value (contents of the type table) is determined by the nodes parent and its left siblings
        - allows for types for declared variables to propagate to where that variable is used
    - **NOTE:** all attributes are either **synthetic** or **inherited**, never both yet one of the two.
- rules for type table
    - to differentiate between nodes we use subscripts
        - ex: <code>[s<sub>1</sub>] -> [decl] [s<sub>2</sub>]</code>
        - therefore, we can write:
            - <code>s<sub>2</sub>.typetable := s<sub>1</sub>.typetable UNION decl.typetable</code>
    - must create a synthesized attribute to propagate attribute upwards
        - ex: <code>decl.typebinding := ((var).name, (type).type)</code>
    - note: type checking will usually happen at the assign node

### Axiomatic Semantics

- this will either be on the midterm or the final, not both
- https://github.com/caswolfe/KnowledgeBase/blob/master/Classes/EECS345/L07.md
- give the meaning of a program by logically proving what it does
- given a precondition of a function, what is the result of that operation on said precondition
    - ex:
        - precondition: <code>x > 5</code>
        - <code>x = x + 10</code>
        - result: <code>x > 15</code>
    -work backwards
        - fill in the previous line with substitutions from the sequential one
        - ex:
            line | code | weakest precondition
            :--: | :--- | :-------------------
            1 | <code>int x = 0;</code> | <code>x = 0</code>
            2 | <code>for(int x = 0; x \< 10, x++>){</code> | <code>x \>= 0</code> (this is the loop invariant)
            3 | <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = x;</code> | <code> y \<= x </code>
            4 | <code>}</code> | <code>y >= 10</code> (notice that this is the same as line #2, just w/ y replaced f/ x)



### Denotational Semantics

- mapping a syntax construct to a mathematical object
- **<code>M<sub>value</sub></code>**
    - m stands for "mapping"
    - maps the value of a symbol
    - ex: <code>M<sub>value</sub>('123') = Mv('1') * 100 + Mv('2') * 10 + Mv('3')</code>
    - used to convert from BNF rules to actual values
- **state**
    - a mathematical object which is a mapping between names a values
    - ex: <code>((x,5)(y,10),(z,0))</code>
        - can us a **LOOKUP** function to retrieve variable values
    - this should be conjoined with  Mv functions to conjoin BNF rules and variable values
    - therefore: <code>Mv(*variable*, state) = Mv(Lookup(*variable*, state))</code>
- Side Effects
    - can happen if a state changes in a conditional
    - ex: <code>if(i = 3 > 2)</code> would have an affect on the state of the program
    - to account for this make sure you replace <code>state</code> with <code>Ms(\<conditional\>, Ms(state))</code> where it is needed. Just be sure to think through these problems thoroughly.

### Scope
- static scope
    - scoping as known in Java, aka *scope of declaration*
- dynamic scope
    - uses the most recent variable in the call stack

### Binding
- values, type and other properties have different "binding times", or when they are assigned there value. possible binding times are:
    - compile time
        - types are bound to variables
    - run time
        - values are bound to variables
- these are a few examples, just keep this in mind incase it is in the test anywhere
