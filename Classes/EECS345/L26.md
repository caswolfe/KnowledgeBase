## Memory Management - memory leaks
- memory leak
    - memory that is allocated but no longer used
- 2 basic solutions:
    1) reference counters - active
        - language must keep track of all the pointers in the program
        - for each piece of allocated memory, have a counter of how many pointers are pointing at it (how many pointers are storing the address)
        - when this number is 0, deallocate the memory
    2) mark and sweep - passive (garbage collection)
        - every now and then, the program will pause and mark all allocated pieces of memory as "not needed".
        - then start at the stack, DPS for references starting from the top. Mark found reference as "still used"
        - once the DFS is done, deallocate any memory still marked as "not needed"
