## scope
- where a binding is active
- scheme creates scope in multiple ways
- function is "let"
- <code>(let ((x 5)(y 6)) [body_expression])</code>  
	- x and y are in scope for the body_expression
	- x in not in the scope of where y is bound
- <code>(let* ((x 5) (y + (+ x 1))) [body_expression])</code>  
	- x is now in scope in the y definition
- <code>(letrec ((x ...)(y ...)) [body_expression])</code>
	- x is in scope inside of "(x ...)", x and y in scope @ "(y ...)"
- could easily do "(&lambda; (x y) [body_expression])" instead of "let"
- let* as a function
	- "(&lambda;(x) ((&lambda;(y) [body_expression]) (+ x 1)) 5)"s
- dynamic scoping uses the closes definition on the call stack
- static scoping uses the closest one in terms of the program, this is the scoping that we're used to w/ java
- when we exe a func call, a stack frame is placed on the stack
	- stack frame contains:
		- space f/ all variables and method params
		- Dynamic Link (pointer to previous frame on the stack)
		- static link (point to the stack frame of the function call containing this function)
- every time you call a function, a stack frame is placed on the call stack
- tail recursion (acumulator)
	- the last operation in a function is the recursive call
		- (only one call)
