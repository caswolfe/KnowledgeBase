## memory management cont
- dangling pointer problem
    - a pointer to memory that was deallocated
- solution 1 "tombstones"
    - pointer points indirectly to the allocated memory
    - process
        - allocates memory like normal
        - send the address to an intermediate location
        - p then points to that intermediate location
        - when the memory is deallocated the intermediate then stores a indirect pointer flag.
    - disadvantages
        - uses more memory (tombstones need to persist)
        - slower b/c of multiple accesses
- solution 2 "lock and key"
    - each pointer has a second value (the "key")
    - each piece of allocated memory has a "lock"
    - disadvantages
        - hard cap on number of pointers
        - can't have arbitrary pointers to pieces of allocated memory
        - extra space needed
        - cost to check lock & key
        - memory gets fragmented

## stack memory allocation
- tombstone can work on the stack, lock and key can't
