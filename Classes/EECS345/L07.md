# L07 - January 29th 2020

- todays topic will be on either the midterm or the final, not both. Please dear God Chad look at this before the midterm and final...
- hint from prof.
	- go through the stack of the method assuming it works correctly (see what happens if you recurse on the car and on the cdr, and if/how we can combine that). Then design your recursive calls around that and adjust accordingly

# Axiomatic Semantics
- give the meaning of a program by logically proving what it does
- given a precondition of a function, operation, expression, what is the result of that operation
- ex:
	- precondition: x > 5
	- x = x + 10
	- Result x > 15
- to automate this, we will compute the "weakest precondition" of an operation given a post condition
	- suppose given "we need x > 15",
		- "we know the operation is x = x + 10", what is the weakest precondition
		- precondition: x > 15
	- A) <code>x = x + 5</code>  
	- B) <code>y = y * x</code>  
	- C) <code>y = y - 3</code>  
	- need <code>y > 0</code>  
	- now:
		- <code>y - 3 > 0</code> or <code>y > 3</code> from A
		- <code>y * x > 3</code> from B
		- <code>y(x + 5) > 3</code> from C
- <code>If (x > 0)(x = x + 7)else(x = x - y)</code>
	- post condition is <code>x < 10</code>  
	- both of the statements' post condition is the overall post condition
	- precond f/ false
		- <code>x - y < 10</code>
	- precond f/ true
		- <code>x + y <10</code>
	- precond f/ if statement
		- if y > 0 then x + y > 10, if y <= 0 then x - y < 10
- good example!
	- if(x < 0)(y = -x)else(y = x)
	- post cond <code>y > 0</code>  
	- post f/ true
		- <code>-x > 0</code> -> <code>x < 0</code>  
	- post f/ false
		- <code>x > 0</code>  
	- post f/ if
		- <code>if(x<0)(-x>0)elif(x >= 0)(y = x</code>  
		- <code>x != 0</code>  
- loop!
	- <code>
	1 count = 1  
	2 while(x > 0){  
	3     count = count * x;  
	4     x = x - 1;  
	5 }  
	</code>
	- post: <code>count = n!</code>
	- need a lop invariant f/ this (what is that???)
	- loop invariant:
		1) is true before the first iteration
		1) is true after each iteration
		1) ((loop invariant) and !(postCondition)) logical equ (loop goal)
	- our loop invariant:
		- line 3 is our precondition
		- must have n! and count in it
		- <code>LI: count = (n!)/((n-x)!), (n-x)!</code>
			- test: line 3
	- got lost, should probably look this up
	- ya man, you need to look this up
