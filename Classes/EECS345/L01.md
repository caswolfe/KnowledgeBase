# L01 - Monday, January 13th

- download resources to code on Wednesday

- Desired properties of programming languages
	- easy to read
	- deterministic (executes the same way every time)
	- good documentation
	- general purpose
	- well defined types
	- large libraries
	- easy to write
	- easy to deal w/ errors
	- easy to debug
	- excellent compilers
	- easy input / output
	- orthogonality (few language features that can be combined in any way that makes sense)
		- ex: should be able to use the addition operator with integers and floats, etc
	- simplicity
	- expressive power (how easy is it to code the idea that you have)
		- how easy it is to express a programming idea
	- easy to maintain
	- standardization
	- open source
	- good secure

- language history
	- Fortran 1958
		- "Formula Translation"
		- IBM
	- Cobol 1960
		- IBM
	- Lisp 1960
		- MIT
	- Algol 1960
		- first attempt at a general purpose language
		- made by committee
		- never actually implemented
		- most sudo-code is written in Algol
	- Algo inspired:
		- Pascal 1970
			- Nicholas F.
			- was a teaching language
		- C 1970
			- AT&T
			- created to make Unix
			- released for free, why it became so popular

- language paradigms
	1) Imperative (follows the structure of a computer)
		- deals with:
			- loops
			- variables
			- assignments
			- procedures
		- Fortran, Pascal, C
	1) Functional
		- deals with
			- parameters
			- recursion
		- Lisp
		- Scheme (1970)
		- Pascal
		- ML
	1) Logical
		- Predicate calculus
		- Prolog
	1) Object Oriented
		- uses objects that send messages to each other
		- Small Talk (first OOL) Xerox 1970's
		- Java 1990's
		- C#
		- C++ 1980's
