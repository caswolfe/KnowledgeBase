## Types and Type Systems
- what is a type?
    - The set of all legal values for the type (denotational definition)
        - ex:
            - String: ("", "A", "AA", ...)
    - Either a primitive type of the language or a compound type built up of other types
        - ex:
            - A string is a sequence of char values
            - a char is a . . .
    - All operations we can do on values of the type
        - ex (string):
            - can concatenate, get length, charAt(index), subString(index1, index2), . . .
- a type system has:
    1) type equivalence
    1) type compatibility
    1) type inference
- type equivalence
    - when are two types considered to be the same?
            - ie we can use values of each type interchangeably
        1) structural equivalence
            - two types are the same if they have the same structure (made up of the same pieces combined in the same way)
            - ex:
                - array(0...9) of Integer
                - array(1...10) of Integer
                - are these structurally equivalent?
                - type rgb_color = struct(r: 8-bit int, g: 8-bit int, b: 8-bit int)
                - type hsv_color = struct(h: 8-=bit int, s: 8-bit int, v: 8-bit int)
                    - (hue, saturation, value)
                - are these equivalent?
        1) name equivalence  
            <code>
            typedef fahrenheit int;  
            typedef celsius int;
            </code>
            1. strict name equivalence
                - int, fahrenheit, and celsius are NOT equivalent
            2. loose name equivalence
                - int, fahrenheit, and celsius ARE equivalent
            - are aliases of types considered to be equivalent
- type compatibility
    - if we have type compatibility we will coerce the value of the "unexpected" type to the expected type.
        - ex: <code>double x = 10</code>
            - int is compatible with double
            - int is coerced into double
    - two kinds of type casts & coercions
        1) where the data of the value must be changed
        1) where the data is not changed
- type inference
    - given an expression of the language, can we infer the type of that expression?
    - discrete math types example:
        - <code>p AND q</code> = structure that contains p and q
        - <code>p OR q</code> = union that can be type P or type q
        - <code>p -> q</code> = a function that takes type p as input and produces type q
        - to infer a type, we can do discrete math type proof  
        <code>
        double f(ind x){ type of 'f' is int to double}  
        int g(char c){type of g is char to int}  
        </code>
        - ```f(g('a'))``` is the same as doing 
            - (char -> int) (int -> double) = (char -> double)
    - strict typing (strong typing):
        - the language prohibits the use of values that violate the type system
    - static typing
        - type rules are enforced by the compiler
