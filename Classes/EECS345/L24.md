# L24 - March 18th, 2020

- look at the call/cc homework where we summed the numbers for a hint to try/catch

## interpreting functions
- creating a closure
    - closure will consist of
        1) formal parameters
        1) function body
        1) function that creates the state/environment that is active for the function call
- when a function definition is found, need to create a closure for the function and store that closure in the state, bound to the function name
    - when a function is called, need to
        1) create the state for the function call, by calling the function in the closure
        1) add a layer to that, evaluate each opf the actual params (in the current state), bind them to the formal parameters, and place in the function's state
        1) execute the function body, setting a new return continuation
        1) if not using boxes when the func returns you need to update the current state with the changes made to the function's state
- see <code>closure_demo.rkt</code> for an example
- end of closures for functions. . .

## Memory Management
- memory errors
    - memory leak
        - when you allocate memory but loose the reference such that you can no longer reallocate it.
    - dangling pointer
        - when you deallocate memory but you still have a reference to the memory, where the reference throws an error when that reference is then deallocated again
    - segmentation violation
        - when you try to access memory that your process is not permitted to access
    - stack smash
        - when a buffer (allocated on a stack) is overflown where it overrides the allocated memory adjacent to it.
