# L19 - February 26th, 2020

- no more axiomatic or static semantic questions! (except for definition questions like the first few in the midterm)
- interpreter will be posted tonight / tomorrow
    - blocks of code
        - <code>while(x < y>){}</code>
        - not the loop, separate from the loop
        - scope declared within a block is limited to within the block
        - should be able to hide wider scope vars with lower scope vars of the same name
            - need **layers** on the state
                - global layer
                    - <code>((m) (*global*))</code>
                    - <code>(((m) (*new*)) ((m) (*global*)))</code>
                    - when the program enters a block, a new layer is pushed onto the state
                    - variable declares go onto the top of the stack
                    - when exiting the layer is popped
                - can do this w/ M<sub>state</sub>
                    - <code>M<sub>state</sub>(\<*block*\> -> {\<*statement list*\>}, *state*) = ?</code>
    - goto's
        - jumps to other places in the code
        - implement
            - <code>continue</code>
                - jump to the start of a loop (inside of a loop)
            - <code>break</code>
                - skips the rest of the code in a loop (inside of a loop)
            - <code>throw</code>
                -
