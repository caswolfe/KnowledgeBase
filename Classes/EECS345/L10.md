# L10 - February 5th, 2020

## abstraction
- using a name to represent a program construct
- (bring computers Friday, will code)
- **bind time**
	- when we attach the program construct to the name
- **life time**
	- how long the binding is active/exists
- some list
	1) language design time
	1) language implementation time
	1) program writing time
	1) compile time
	1) link time
		- when the program connects and loads to an api
	1) load time
		- the OS loading the program from disk to memory (RAM)
	1) run time
<code>
char authorize(char password[], int length){  
	if(srncmp("Password123", password, length)==0)  
		return 1; //authorized  
	return 0; //not authorized  
}  
</code>
- binding lifetime vs object lifetime
	- object lifetime
		- how long the object exists
		- (how long is it allocated in our program)
		- 3 forms of allocation
			- heap allocation
				- unorganized memory (java)
			- stack allocation
				- on the stack
			- static allocation
				- hard coded in src
