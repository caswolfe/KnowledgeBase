## memory management cont
- problem w/ garbage collection is that you must stop the program
- how oracle handles this w/ java (industry standard)
    - divides the heap into sections:
        - eden
        - S0/S1
        - tenured memory
        - permanent memory
    - all new allocations are from eden
    - permanent memory is used f/ things like class objects
    - when eden fills up, the program stalls to do a garbage collection
        - as such only the memory in eden & S0/S1 is explored
    - note that one of the S0/S1 is used, the other is empty
    - everything that survives the garbage collection is placed in the empty S0/S1, then eden and the other S0/S1 is emptied
    - if an allocated piece of memory survives a number of times (actual number unknown), it is placed into "tenured memory"
- discussion points
    - start w/ marking all memory in tenured as "needed"
    - what happens if something is S0 is only pointed to by something in Tenured?
- what happens when tenured fills up?
    - the system stops and does a full garbage collection including everything in tenured and permanent (along w/ eden, S0/S1)
- according to studies of program memory, memory will mainly be short-life or the span of the program
