# L01 Intro - January 14th, 2020

TA office hours 10:30-12 @ Olin 504

- half of the exam questions will be in class not on the slides :/

# Ch 02

- Compiler Vs. Interpreter
	- compiler
		- source -> assembly
		- delivered program can't be changed
		- executes 100's of times faster
		- execution can be optimized
	- Interpreter
		- processes each line of code, translates it, then executes it
		- easy to modify
		- no compilation time
- steps of compilation processes
	- lexical analysis
		- breaking up each line into *Tokens* (words)
	- syntax analysis
		- making sure token fit grammar
	- semantic analysis
		- making sure that scope and types fit together
- lexical ex:  
	<code>TotalFee := Cost + Tax</code>  
	- Tokens:  
		- "TotalFee"
		- ":="
		- "Cost"
		- "+"
		- "Tax"
- Syntax analysis
	- <code>TotalFee := Cost + Tax</code>  
	- <code>variable assignment variable operator variable</code>  
- Semantic
	- Type checking
	- etc...  
- Top down compiler design
	- Front End translation
	- Interface f/ intermediate state
	- back end - semantic analysis and code generation
- Major components
	- Source
	- Scanner
		- Scans source & creates tokens
	- Tokens
		- smallest element, consisting 1+ characters. one created f/ each element
	- Parse
	- Page 15 has some explanation for something
- for class next week, we should have done the "hello world" done. (Ch 2)
- should read Ch2

# Ch 03

- 4 main token types f/ Ch 3
	- word
	- number
	- string
	- special symbol
- determine whether a word token is an identifier or a pascal reserved word
- calc value of num token & determine whether its type is int or real
- perform syntax error handling
- how to scan f/ tokens
	- scan past blanks, find first char, create token
	- iterate through characters and add until you hit a special characters
	- token is created
- Exam Question - modify word diagram
	- modify word diagram to include '_' in the middle of words
