# L03

- homeworks now due Monday night
- for exponent just have them be two different tokens
	- ex:
		- 13e4
		- 13 e4
		- same way we'd treat 13k4
		- value then identifier
- constant should be an identifier
- can still do extra credit
- can throw error when identifier ends in an underscore
- for A_B$, the "A_B" will be a valid identifier and the "$" will be an error
	- the code all ready handles this for us
- recitation will be about debugging
- for _Ship...
	- _ is invalid token
	- Ship... is an identifier

- f/ homework
	- add counter for number of times an identifier appears
	- (remember, identifiers will be / are case sensitive)
