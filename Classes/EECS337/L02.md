# Ch 04
- program execution
	- structured languages usually use a stack
	- variables will be placed on the stack
	- every time there is a function call, the return address is placed on he tack along with the variables passed into the function
	- local varialbles also on the stack
	- f/ recursive calls, a copy of the vars will be placed on the stack and so on
- symbol table
	- note that jasmin doesn't support nested scopes
	- there is a global symbol table to store global variables
	- there is a symbol table for each function, var name, type and record
	- symbol tables will be used on the stack
	- all string tokens which arnt reserved words will be in the symbol table
- SymbolTableStack
	- will contain 1+ symbol tables, one for each scope, each one with 1+ entries
	- needs <code>getLocalSymbolTable</code>
	- and <code>enterLocal</code>
	- and <code>LoopupLocal</code>
	- and <code>Lookup</code>
- SymbolTableEntries
	- <code>GetName</code>
	- <code>GeySymbolTable</code>
	- <code>AppendLineNumber</code>
	- <code>SetAttribute</code>
	- <code>GetAttribute</code>
